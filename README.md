# Pong

## Description
Pong was built to be run on a DE1-SoC circuit board.
Using Verilog HDL, we were able to control various inputs on the DE1-SoC
board to take user input and modify internal states, as well as controlling
board VGA output to display the game itself.

U of T CSC258 Final Project, in collaboration with Henry Wang.

## Features
- Uses a VGA adaptor script to display the Pong game using DE1-SoC board's VGA output.
- Displays game score using DE1-SoC board's hex display
- Uses DE1-SoC board's push buttons, switches to control the paddles for Pong.
